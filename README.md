# Find-It-
Algorithm final project 
Authors: Marcos Garc√≠a, Alejandro Felip, Alonso Ramos, Pablo Khouri and Gonzalo Sainz De Aja

Language for our program:
-	Python

Packages needed for our program:
-	Python version 3.8

Specifications of our code will be separated into steps:

1. To use our code you just need to run the code. We tried to make our code as simple as possible, so the user does not have to write or think a lot. Once you write the option you will have to press <enter>.

2. Once you run the code, they will ask you several questions regarding what the user wants. The first question will be if you have any preference or if you just want information about a restaurant of a certain type of food.

3. You will have to choose writing 1 or 2 depending on the user (this will be specified in the code). 

4. If you choose option 1 the user will have to select the type of food they want(Italian, American, Turkish, Japanese and Spanish) once the user writes down the option they want and they press <enter>, the program will print the restaurants of that type.

5. If you choose option 2 the user will be asked more questions depending on what they choose, the user will have to type(time, price or location) depending on their reference and then press <enter>.

6. The preferences are: If the shop is open at a certain time, the zone where the user wants the restaurant, or the price they are willing to pay. 
    - If you choose the time preference, you will have to write down the time in terms of 24 hours and press <enter>.
    - If you choose the zone preference, you will have to write down one of the two options: (Plaza of aqueduct) and press <enter>.
    - If you choose the price preference, you will have to write down a number from 1 to 3 from cheap to expensive, and press <enter>.

7. The algorithm will print the restaurants that meet the condition.

The focus of our algorithm is to give information as quickly as possible in a very simple way. We want the user to know quickly and in a simple way the information about the restaurants in Segovia. This is the reason we used hash tables. Which is quick for the algorithm we wanted to develop.


We though that since there are not enough places in Segovia, we are not going to add the option of meeting various preferences. If we expanded the idea to another places, we would allow inputting various preferences.



We also must remember that it is important to know that this is the minimal viable product. So, we did not go deep in trying to print various conditions simultaneously. And we just want a simple program to search information to a relatively small place, plaza and aqueduct of Segovia.
