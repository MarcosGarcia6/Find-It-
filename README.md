Language for our program:
   - Python version 3.8


Environment for our program:
   - Pycharm
   
Imported libraries:
   - heapq_max
   To install type the following command: pip install heapq_max
   
Operative system: 
   - Windows 
 

Specifications of our code will be separated into steps:

1. To use our code you just need to run the code. We tried to make our code as simple as possible, so the user does not have to write or think a lot. Once you write the option you will have to press <enter> in every question.

2. Once you run the code, they will ask you several questions regarding what the user wants. The first question will be what kind of food is the user looking for.

3. You will have to choose writing down the type of food they want(Italian, American, Turkish, Japanese and Spanish) and then press <enter>.

4. The next preference will be the time. The user is able to choose between 14 and 21(Going for dinner or lunch). The user will have to write down one of the two options and press <enter>.
  
5. The following preference will be the zone. The user is able to choose between plaza and aqueduct. The user will have to write down one of the two options and press <enter>.

6. The last preference will be the price. The user is able to choose in a range between 1 and 3(from cheaper to more expensive). The user will have to write down one of the three options and press <enter>.

7. The algorithm will print first the restaurant that meets all the conditions. Then, by pressing <enter> you will be able to see the following restaurants that meet more conditions.
